# The-Last-Checkpoint-

I feel highly motivated and prepared to take the next step in my career journey. The bootcamp has equipped me with both technical skills and problem-solving methodologies that I’m eager to apply in a professional setting. While there’s always more to learn, I’m confident in my ability to adapt, grow, and contribute effectively in a new role.

 Next Steps:

Start applying for full-stack or backend developer roles.

Continue LeetCode/CodeWars practice for interviews.

Build 1-2 more portfolio projects with advanced features.

Excited for what’s ahead!
